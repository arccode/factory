# Task start conditions:
start on (runlevel [!S]
          and started system-services
          and filesystem
          and static-network-up)

# all-umpire.conf starts each umpire daemon with board environ var. And itself
# is a short-run task that ends itself.

# Connects standard input to /dev/null. Standard output and standard error are
# connected to one end of a pseudo-terminal such that any job output is
# automatically logged to a file in directory /var/log/upstart/ .
