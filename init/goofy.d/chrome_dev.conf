# Touch related settings.
# By default Chrome enables DOM touch events only if it sees a touchscreen
# (--auto).  However some devices may have touch service started later (for
# instance, hid-i2c) than UI and causing the first created window in Chrome does
# not enable DOM touch events (it may still see touch screen and allowing pinch
# effect) until a new window is created (or reloaded).
# For factory testing, we should enable touch-events and disable pinch effect.
# If a project does not have touch screen and seeing problems due to these
# settings please remove or comment them in the factory branch.

# Chrome browser does not allow the first window with pre-specified starting
# URL to capture keyboard focus any more. Until this is changed, we have to
# reload the page. Loading the extension page instead of directly URL
# (http://localhost:4012) solves the problem.
# See issue http://crbug.com/627372 for more information.
#
# Chrome browser block the first window being extension page too. We use a data
# URI to redirect to the extension page.
# See issue http://crbug.com/766570 for more information.
